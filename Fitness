"""Simple fitness calculator for women.

This script calculates the daily calorie intake needed to achieve different goals
based on body weight, age and activity level. It supports the goals of
maintaining weight, losing weight, gaining weight and body recomposition.

The calculator uses a simplified BMR formula that only depends on weight and
assumes an average height. Activity multipliers are based on common guidelines.
This is not medical advice; consult a professional for personalized
recommendations.
